## Boolos and Jeffrey's _Computability and Logic_ ##

This repo contains LaTeX source and finished PDFs of
my coursework for a Directed Studies class on computability
and metalogic. I'm taking this course in the Fall of 2014 at
the University of South Florida under the direction of Professor Eric Winsberg.
